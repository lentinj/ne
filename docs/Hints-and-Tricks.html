<dt><em class="emph">Use <kbd class="key">f1</kbd> or <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>-<kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>, not <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Due to the limitations of the techniques used when communicating with a
terminal, it is not possible to &ldquo;decide&rdquo; that the user pressed the
<kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> key for about a second after the actual key press
(see <a class="pxref" href="EscapeTime.html">EscapeTime</a>). This means that you will experience annoying delays when
using menus. If you have no <kbd class="key">f1</kbd> key, use <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>-<kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>, or
redefine a keystroke assigning the command <code class="code">Escape</code>, and you will be
able to use that keystroke instead of <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>. Unfortunately,
some GUI-based terminals (most notably, <code class="code">gnome-terminal</code>) use <kbd class="key">f1</kbd>
for their own purposes; in that case, you can assign the <code class="code">Escape</code>
command to another key (see <a class="pxref" href="Configuration.html">Configuration</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Check for the presence of a <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd> key.</em></dt>
<dd><p>If your system has a standard <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd> or <kbd class="key">Alt</kbd> key, there is a
good chance that you have several other shortcuts. If the built-in
<kbd class="key">Meta</kbd> bindings do not work, you must discover which is the effect
of the <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd> in your terminal emulator. Indeed, it is possible in
theory to configure about 150 shortcuts. See <a class="xref" href="Configuration.html">Configuration</a>. In any
case, prefixing a key with <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> has the same effect as holding
down <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd>, so with the standard key bindings
you can, for instance, advance by word with <kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">Escape</kbd></kbd> followed by <kbd class="kbd">F</kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">When editing very large files, please use the <code class="code">--no-syntax</code> option.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Even if <code class="code">ne</code> will switch transparently to memory-mapped disk files, syntax
highlighting requires a great deal of additional memory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Mac users should turn on &ldquo;Delete sends CTRL-H&rdquo; in the <code class="command">Terminal</code> settings.</em></dt>
<dd><p>If you are a Mac user, you need to check the &ldquo;Delete sends CTRL-H&rdquo; option
in the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Advanced</samp>&rsquo; tab of the <code class="command">Terminal</code> application settings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph"><code class="code">ne</code> does tilde expansion.</em></dt>
<dd><p>When you have to specify a file name, you can always start with <samp class="file">~/</samp> in
order to specify your home directory, or <samp class="file">~<var class="var">user</var>/</samp> to
specify the home directory of another user.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">It is easy to correct bad colors.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes, due to different opinions about the best default foreground and
background colors, some of the color choices in a syntax file might be
unreadable (for instance, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">dim white</samp>&rsquo; on a terminal with a white
background). Just copy the guilty syntax specification file to the
<samp class="file">~/.ne/syntax</samp> directory, and change the color names at the start of
the file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Use the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">tabs</samp>&rsquo; syntax to distinguish <small class="sc">TAB</small>s from <small class="sc">SPACE</small>s.</em></dt>
<dd><p>When you&rsquo;re struggling to clean up a mix of <small class="sc">TAB</small>s and <small class="sc">SPACE</small>s,
temporarily switching to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">tabs</samp>&rsquo; syntax may help. The command
<code class="command">Syntax tabs</code> makes <small class="sc">TAB</small> characters show up in a different
background color from <small class="sc">SPACE</small>s. Once you&rsquo;ve gotten your white space
issues straightened out, you can switch back to the syntax appropriate
for your current file type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph"><code class="code">ne</code> does interactive filename completion.</em></dt>
<dd><p>When you have to specify a file name as last element of a long input,
you can invoke the completer using <kbd class="key">Tab</kbd>. If you hit it twice in a
row, you will enter the file requester, where you can navigate and
escape back to the command line, either with <kbd class="key">f1</kbd>, which will let
you edit again your previous input, or with <kbd class="key">Tab</kbd>, which will copy
your current selection over your previous file name. In other words, you
can freely alternate completion, editing and browsing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Disable the status bar for slow connections.</em></dt>
<dd><p><code class="code">ne</code> tries to emit as few characters as possible when updating the
screen. However, for each key you type it is likely that the status
bar has to be updated. If your connection is very slow, you can
disable the status bar to get a quicker response (see <a class="pxref" href="StatusBar.html">StatusBar</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">The <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> delay when activating menus can be avoided.</em></dt>
<dd><p>If you press after <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> any key that does not produce the second
character of an escape sequence, <code class="code">ne</code> will immediately recognize the
<kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> key code as such. Since non-alphabetical keys have no effect while
browsing through the menus, if you&rsquo;re forced to use <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> as menu
activator you can press, for instance, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">,</samp>&rsquo; just after it to speed
up the menu activation (note that &lsquo;<samp class="samp">:</samp>&rsquo; would not work, because it would
activate the command line). Alternatively, you can just type <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>
twice in a row.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Use turbo mode for lengthy operations.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Turbo mode (see <a class="pxref" href="Turbo.html">Turbo</a>) allows performing very complex operations
without updating the screen until the operations are complete. This can
be a major plus if you are editing very long files, or if your terminal
is slow. If the default value (0, which means twice the number of
visible rows) does not give you the best results, experiment other
values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Regular expressions are powerful, and slow.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Regular expressions must be studied very carefully. If you spend a lot
of time doing editing, it is definitely reasonable to study even their
most esoteric features. Very complex editing actions can be performed by
a single find/replace using the <code class="code">\<var class="var">n</var></code> convention. But remember
always that regular expressions are much slower than a normal search: in
particular, if you use them on a UTF-8 text, <code class="code">ne</code> has to transform
them into an equivalent (but more complex) expression that cannot match
partially a UTF-8 sequence, and this expansion makes the search even
slower.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Use the correct movement commands in a macro.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Many boring, repetitive editing actions can be performed in a breeze
by recording them the first time. Remember, however, that while recording
a complex macro you should always use a cursor movement that will apply
in a different context. For instance, if you are copying a word, you cannot
move with cursor keys, because that word at another application of the
macro could be of a different length. Rather, use the next/previous word
keys and the <code class="code">MoveEOW</code> command, which guarantee a correct behaviour in
all situations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Some preferences can be preserved even with automatic preferences.</em></dt>
<dd><p>When you save an autoprefs file, the file simply contains a macro that,
when executed, produces the current configuration. However, you could want,
for instance, to never change the insert/overwrite state. In this case, just
edit the autoprefs files with <code class="code">ne</code> and delete the line containing the
command setting the insert flag. When the autoprefs are loaded later, the
insert flag will be left untouched. This trick is particularly useful with
the <code class="code">StatusBar</code> and <code class="code">FastGUI</code> commands.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">If some keystrokes do not work, check for system-specific features.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes it can happen that a keystroke does not work&mdash;for instance,
<kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">Control</kbd>-O</kbd> does not open a file. This usually is due to the kernel
tracking that key for its purposes. For instance, along a <code class="code">telnet</code>
connection with xon/xoff flow control, <kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">Control</kbd>-S</kbd> and
<kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">Control</kbd>-Q</kbd> would block and release the output
instead of saving and quitting.
</p>
<p>In these cases, if you do not need the system
feature you should check how to disable it: for instance, some <small class="sc">BSD</small>-like
systems feature a delayed suspend signal that is not in the <small class="sc">POSIX</small>
standard, and thus cannot be disabled by <code class="code">ne</code>. On <small class="sc">HP-UX</small>, the command
<code class="code">stty dsusp ^-</code> would disable the signal, and would let the control
sequence previously assigned to it to run up to <code class="code">ne</code>.
