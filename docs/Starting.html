<p>To start <code class="code">ne</code>, just type &lsquo;<samp class="samp">ne</samp>&rsquo; and press <kbd class="key">Return</kbd>. If you
want to edit some specific file(s), you can put their name(s) on the command
line just after the command name, as for any <small class="sc">UN*X</small> command. The
screen of your terminal will be cleared (or filled with text loaded
from the first file you specified). You can also pipe the result of a
command directly into <code class="code">ne</code>: it will be loaded and opened as the first
document. See <a class="ref" href="Arguments.html">Arguments</a> for other command line options.
</p>
<p>Writing text is pretty straightforward: if your terminal is properly
configured, every key will (should) do what you expect. Alphabetic
characters insert text, cursor keys move the cursor, and so on. You can
use the <kbd class="key">Delete</kbd> and <kbd class="key">Backspace</kbd> key to perform corrections. If
your keyboard has an <kbd class="key">Insert</kbd> key, you can use it to <em class="dfn">toggle</em>
(switch from on to off, or vice versa) insert mode. In general,
<code class="code">ne</code> tries to squeeze everything it can from your
keyboard. Function keys and special movement keys should work
flawlessly if your terminal is properly configured. If not, complain to
your system administrator. If that doesn&rsquo;t help, see <a class="ref" href="Key-Bindings.html">Key Bindings</a>.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen, you will see a line containing some numbers and
letters. This is called the <em class="dfn">status bar</em> because it reports to you part of
the internal state of the editor. At startup, the status bar has the following form:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"> L:       1 C:       1  12% ia----pvu-t------@A* &lt;unnamed&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>(the numbers could be different, and a file name could be shown as
last item instead of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;unnamed&gt;</samp>&rsquo;). You probably already guessed
that the numbers after &lsquo;<samp class="samp">L:</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">C:</samp>&rsquo; are your cursor&rsquo;s line and column
numbers, respectively, whereas the percentage indicates approximately
your position in the file. The small letters represent user flags that
you can turn on and off. In particular, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">i</samp>&rsquo; tells you that insert
mode is on, while &lsquo;<samp class="samp">p</samp>&rsquo; tells that the automatic preferences system
is activated. The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">*</samp>&rsquo; means this document has not been saved. For a
thorough explanation of the meaning of the flags on the status bar, see
<a class="ref" href="The-Status-Bar.html">The Status Bar</a>.
</p>
<p>Once you are accustomed to cursor movement and line editing, it is time to
press <kbd class="key">f1</kbd> (the first function key), or in case your keyboard does not
have such a key, <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>. Immediately, the <em class="dfn">menu bar</em> will appear,
and the first menu will be drawn. (If you find yourself waiting for the menu
to appear, you can press <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> twice in a row.) You can now move
around menus and menu items by pressing the cursor keys. Moreover, a lower
case alphabetic key will move to the next item in the current menu whose name starts with that
letter, and an upper case alphabetic key will move to the next menu whose
name starts with that letter.
</p>
<p>Moving around the menus should give you an idea of the capabilities of
<code class="code">ne</code>. If you want to save your work, you should use the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Save As...</samp>&rsquo;
item from the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">File</samp>&rsquo; menu. Menus are fully discussed in <a class="ref" href="Menus.html">Menus</a>.
When you want to exit from the menu system, press <kbd class="key">f1</kbd> (or <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>)
again. If instead you prefer to choose a command and execute it, move
to the respective menu item and press <kbd class="key">Return</kbd>.
</p>
<p>At the end of several menu items you will find strange symbols like
<kbd class="kbd">^A</kbd> or <kbd class="key">f1</kbd>. They represent <em class="dfn">shortcuts</em> for the respective
menu items. In other words, instead of activating, selecting and
executing a menu item, which can take seconds, you can simply press a
couple of keys. The symbol &lsquo;<samp class="samp">^</samp>&rsquo; in front of a character denotes the
shortcut produced by the <kbd class="key">Control</kbd> key plus that character (we
assume here that you are perfectly aware of the usage of the
<kbd class="key">Control</kbd> key: it is just as if you had to type a capital letter
with <kbd class="key">Shift</kbd>). The descriptions of the form <kbd class="key">f</kbd><var class="var">n</var> represent
instead function keys. Finally, the symbol &lsquo;<samp class="samp">[</samp>&rsquo; in front of a
character denotes the shortcut produced by <kbd class="key">Control</kbd> plus <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd>
(a.k.a. <kbd class="key">Alt</kbd>) plus that character, <em class="emph">or</em> <kbd class="key">Meta</kbd> plus that
character, depending on your terminal emulator&mdash;you must check for
yourself. Moreover, these last bindings may not work with some
terminals, in which case you can replace them with a sequence: just
press the <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> key followed by the letter. A few menu items are
bound to two control sequences (just in case one does not work, or it is
impractical).
</p>
<p>Note that under certain conditions (for instance, while using
<code class="code">ne</code> through a <code class="code">telnet</code> connection) some of the shortcuts
might not work because they are trapped by the operating system for
other purposes (see <a class="pxref" href="Hints-and-Tricks.html">Hints and Tricks</a>).
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the third and last interface to <code class="code">ne</code>&rsquo;s features: the
<em class="dfn">command line</em>. If you press <kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">Control</kbd>-K</kbd>, or <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> followed by
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">:</samp>&rsquo; (a la <code class="code">vi</code>), you will be requested to enter a command
to execute. Just press <kbd class="key">Return</kbd> for the time being (or, if you are
really interested in this topic, see <a class="pxref" href="The-Command-Line.html">The Command Line</a>).
</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, when explaining how to use a command we
shall usually describe the corresponding menu item. The related shortcut
and command can be found on the menu item itself, and in <a class="ref" href="Menus.html">Menus</a>.
