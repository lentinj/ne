<p>The main inspiration for this work came from Martin Taillefer&rsquo;s
<code class="code">TurboText</code> for the Amiga, which is the best editor I ever saw on
any computer.
</p>
<p>The first versions of <code class="code">ne</code> were created on an Amiga 3000T, using
the port of the <code class="code">curses</code> library by Simon John Raybould. After
switching to the lower-level <code class="code">terminfo</code> library, the development
continued under <small class="sc">UN*X</small>. Finally, I ported <code class="code">terminfo</code> to the
Amiga, thus making it possible to develop on that platform again. For
<code class="code">ne</code> 1.0, an effort has been made to provide a <code class="code">terminfo</code>
emulation using GNU&rsquo;s <code class="code">termcap</code>.
The development eventually moved to Linux.
</p>
<p>Todd Lewis got involved with <code class="code">ne</code> when the University of North
Carolina&rsquo;s Chapel Hill campus migrated its central research computers
from <small class="sc">MVS</small> to <small class="sc">UNIX</small> in 1995. The readily available <small class="sc">UNIX</small> editors
had serious weaknesses in their user interfaces, especially from the
standpoint of <small class="sc">MVS</small> users who were not too excited about having to move
their projects to another platform while learning an entirely new suite
of tools. <code class="code">ne</code> offered an easily understood interface with enough
capabilities to keep these new <small class="sc">UNIX</small> users productive. Todd installed and
has maintained <code class="code">ne</code> at UNC since then, making several improvements to the
code to meet his users&rsquo; needs. In early 1999 his code base and
mine were merged to become version 1.17.
</p>
<p>Support for syntax highlighting was added in 2009 with code and
techniques heavily borrowed from the GNU-licensed editor <code class="code">joe</code>,
which was written by Joseph H. Allen. Much of the work to incorporate
this code into <code class="code">ne</code> was undertaken by Daniele Filaretti, an
undergraduate student working under the direction of Sebastiano at the
Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Milano.
