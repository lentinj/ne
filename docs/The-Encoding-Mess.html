<p><code class="code">ne</code> supports UTF-8. It can use UTF-8 for its
input/output, and it can also interpret one or more documents as containing
UTF-8 encoded text, acting accordingly. Note that the document content is
actual UTF-8 text&mdash;<code class="code">ne</code> does not use wide characters. As a
positive side-effect, <code class="code">ne</code> can support fully the ISO-10646
standard, but nonetheless non-UTF-8 texts occupy exactly one byte per
character.
</p>
<p>More precisely, <em class="emph">any</em> piece of text in <code class="code">ne</code> is classified as
US-ASCII, 8-bit or UTF-8. A US-ASCII text contains only US-ASCII
characters. An 8-bit text sports a one-to-one correspondence between
characters and bytes, whereas an UTF-8 text is interpreted in UTF-8.  Of
course, this raises a difficult question: <em class="emph">when</em> should a document be
classified as UTF-8?
</p>
<p>Character encodings are a mess. There is nothing we can do to change
this fact, as character encodings are <em class="emph">metadata that modify data
semantics</em>. The same file may represent different texts of different
lengths when interpreted with different encodings. Thus, there is no safe
way of guessing the encoding of a file.
</p>
<p><code class="code">ne</code> stays on the safe side: it will never try to convert a file
from an encoding to another one. It can, however, interpret data
contained in a document depending on an encoding: in other words,
encodings are truly treated as metadata. You can switch off UTF-8
at any time, and see the same document as a standard 8-bit file.
</p>
<p>Moreover, <code class="code">ne</code> uses a <em class="emph">lazy</em> approach to the problem: first of
all, unless the UTF-8 automatic detection flag is set
(see <a class="pxref" href="UTF8Auto.html">UTF8Auto</a>), no attempt is ever made to consider a file as UTF-8
encoded.  Every file, clip, command line, etc., is firstly scanned for
non-US-ASCII characters: if it is entirely made of US-ASCII characters,
it is classified as US-ASCII. An US-ASCII piece of text is compatible
with anything else&mdash;it may be pasted in any document, or, if it is a
document, it may accept any form of text. Documents classified as US-ASCII
are distinguished by an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">A</samp>&rsquo; on the status bar.
</p>
<p>As soon as a user action forces a choice of encoding (e.g., an accented
character is typed, or an UTF-8-encoded clip is pasted), <code class="code">ne</code> fixes
the mode to 8-bit or UTF-8 (when there is a choice, this depends on
the value of the <a class="ref" href="UTF8Auto.html">UTF8Auto</a> flag). Of course, in some cases this may
be impossible, and in that case an error will be reported.
</p>
<p>All this happens behind the scenes, and it is designed so that in 99% of
the cases there is no need to think of encodings. In any case, should
<code class="code">ne</code>&rsquo;s behaviour not match your needs, you can always change at run
time the level of UTF-8 support.
